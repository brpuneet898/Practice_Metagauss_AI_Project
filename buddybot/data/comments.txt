You say "You must use the same email address for creating an account on Zoom that you used for your WordPress admin." Can it be any admin user or does it have to be the administration email address entered on wp-admin/options-general.php ?Hi,

I have the same issue. My license key for "EventPrime Extended" is no an option in the dropdown to activate. Tried all possible bundles and products from the drop down, but none activates my license again. It all worked fine until the 31st of January.
Raised a support ticket already.

Please let me know urgently how to activate my license, thank you!
OliverI've purchased the plug and the extension from Metagauss but cannot download the latest extensions - can you help?Hi Team,
I have installed EventPrime – Modern Events Calendar, Bookings and Tickets and EventPrime Woocommerce Integration plugin. The licence has been activated and is enabled. In WooCommerce, appropriate payment types have been enabled. There is not an option on the event page to enable WooCommerce Checkout. 
Have I missed something obvious or do I need to have a different licence from the free version.
Best regards
BruceThank you for reaching out! 

We are in the process of creating comprehensive documentation specifically for checkout fields, which will be made available soon. In the interim, you can refer to our Starter Guide where you'll find relevant information under the fifth point (Checkout Fields) within the section titled "Creating A New Event" and some additional details under the "Settings" section. 

If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to contact us. 
We are here to ensure that your experience with EventPrime is smooth and well-informed.Hello, 

Thank you for using EventPrime! 

The fundamental booking process corresponds to creating tickets natively or opting for third-party bookings where the visitor will be redirected to the provided URL. 

In the case of the “EventPrime WooCommerce Checkout” extension, the chosen event’s tickets are added to the cart( you do not need to create a ticket as a WooCommerce product ) and the checkout process will be delegated to the standard WooCommerce checkout process allowing you to utilize the payment gateways configured in the WooCommerce plugin. 

I hope this provides clarity on the matter. 
If you need further clarification or require additional information, please feel free to contact us.

We would like to inform you that our plugin offers two options pertaining to the booking functionality you can either choose to create tickets natively or opt for third-party bookings where the visitors will be redirected to the provided URL.

Kind regardsDo the attendee names link to their profile, or can this be done - so I could send a message to a chosen attendee through a link to their profile?Whats the difference between bookings to events and using WooCommerce?

Below all that there is the description of the person like the demo, but I would like to be able to have exactly the same thing as on the demo without the unnecessary date, title and photo. Can you help me?
THANKS!It is not possible to influence the arrangement of the fields. This is extremely inappropriate! The least important fields are at the top, while the name, for example, is at the bottom. The width or number of fields in a row that cannot be influenced is the lesser evil. In any case, the result looks very unprofessional! Ich hoffe, dass ich vielleicht etwas übersehen habe ...I bought and have the EventPrime plugin installed, yet in the installed plugins it says "Events" and not "Event Prime"; I have the Woocommerce extension installed, yet I don't see the screens you show above. How do I enable the ability to set a price to register and attend an event and pay through the site?Hello, 

Thanks for using EventPrime. 

We're pleased to inform you that the Zapier registration for EventPrime has been submitted. It is currently in the approval queue at Zapier, and we anticipate it to be processed soon.Hello Brian, 

Thanks for using EventPrime! 

This issue might be due to some local script conflict. We will be glad to further look into it, and we highly recommend opening a support ticket with relevant details here: Support - EventPrimeis it possible to show only the next occurrence of a recurring event in the list view? I don't like having a list view that is full of the same event each week.Is this working on Zapier yet?  I uploaded the integration, but I do not see how to connect it in Zapier. EventPrime does not come up as an option.I went through these steps to activate the free version.  The validity is not showing.  Further the test event we added to the site does not populate into the events page. If we can test this system out we will be purchasing premium features.Hello, 

Thanks for using EventPrime. 

Yes, a website user can conveniently add an event from the frontend through our frontend event submission form. This page is auto-generated when you install and activate EventPrime. 
Upon successful event submission, the event will be saved in a draft state in the backend which the admin can review & publish. 

The approved events can be located under the “My Events” section on the "User Profile" page.Hello Imran,
 
We hope you are doing great!
 
We have comprehensively reviewed your website and could not locate a running instance of EventPrime. 
Can you please check and verify whether EventPrime is activated or not? 
 
We will be more than happy to investigate and resolve the issue for you.Hi
 
Is it possible to add events from the frontend? For eg. can the website user add an event from the frontend?

Thanksmy add to cart button is not redirecting to the checkout page
it is directly redirecting to the add to cart page of woocommerceHi Arthur,
 
Thanks for using EventPrime
 
Yes, you can utilize this shortcode: [em_events types="1,2,…" ].
 
Here, you can specify Event-Types IDs in a comma-separated format.Hi Kay,
 
Thanks for using EventPrime.
 
At present, the Zapier App is not public. We have already submitted it to the Zapier team.

They are currently reviewing it.

We will update once it is public.Hi Phil,

Thanks for using EventPrime.

The issue has been resolved and included in the next maintenance release.I've bought this extension and after finally finding these instructions I have it working. However, your instructions say:

'Frontend
On the checkout page, you will notice an Add to Cart option INSTEAD of the usual Checkout.......'

But what actually happens is that it shows the ADD TO CART option AND the CHECKOUT option (not instead) I think this makes it confusing for the customer. You would think that Checkout and Add to Cart would both take you through WooCommerce as that's how WooCommerce works.

I tried switching off PayPal to see if the checkout option disappeared but it didn't. I only want to offer payments through WooCommerce, is this possible?

It need to be really straight forward and at the moment having Add to Cart and Checkout options which use different payment methods will be confusing for people.

PhilHi Arthur, EventPrime works with Divi builder through shortcodes. We will soon support Divi modules.Hello there,

How to integrate Eventprime with Divi? using shortcode or dedicated Divi module?

Thanks
ArthurHello there,

Is it possible to preset a filter with shortcode [em_events]? for example [em_events event_type="Training"], or [em_events event_type_id=27]

ArtHello Larry,

Thanks for your feedback. We will add the 'Duplicate' option in the action links in our upcoming releases.Hello Lee,

Yes, this shortcode is related to the Venue.Hello Larry,

Yes, you can hide the wishlist icon from the front end.

Go to EventPrime's Settings -> click on the 'General' tab -> click on the 'Setup' subtab.

Find the 'Hide Wishlist Icon' option. Enable this to hide this and save the settings.Hello Paul,

You will get all of your extensions from your EventPrime account. Login to your EventPrime account from here.

After login you will see your order details. Click on the 'View Details and Downloads' link. On the next page you will get all of your extensions and their license keys.

Click on the extension and the .zip file will be available to download. Upload it to your plugin's area and activate it.I have purchased the bundle but the additional extensions are not showing in wordpressEventPrime is not showing among the available apps on Zapier🤷🏽‍♀️Is there a way to disable the wishlist feature?  It is not appropriate for my website.Nice to have this feature.  Very useful.

It would be even easier if, when you hovered over an event, the options included "duplicate" along with the "Edit|Quick Edit|Trash|View".

And, after publishing an event, if there was a duplicate button on the edit event screen.What is an Event Site ([em_event_site id=”x”])? 

A Venue? Or is this legacy for an older plugin?
